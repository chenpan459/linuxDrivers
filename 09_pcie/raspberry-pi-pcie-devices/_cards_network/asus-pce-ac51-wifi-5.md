This WiFi card supports 802.11ac, and has drivers available for Linux and Windows, at least, but I have had trouble getting these drivers running (or even installable) on the Pi.

Many of the forked Linux drivers won't compile on ARM64 or ARMv7, so I have also tried using the card with a recompiled Linux kernel following my [cross-compile guide](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/tree/master/extras/cross-compile), with the following module selected via `menuconfig`:

```
Device Drivers
  > Network device support
    > Wireless LAN
      > Realtek rtlwifi family of devices
        > Realtek RTL8821AE/RTL8812AE Wireless Network Adapter
```

This seems to load the kernel module (`rtl8821ae`), but the card won't work as in the `dmesg` logs I get:

```
$ dmesg | grep rtl
