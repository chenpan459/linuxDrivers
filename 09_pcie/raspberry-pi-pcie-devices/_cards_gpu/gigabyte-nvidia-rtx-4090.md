The RTX 4090 is supported by both Nvidia's proprietary driver and the open source Nouveau driver in the Linux Kernel.

It will require a 1x to 16x adapter, or some other means of adapting the 16x-sized card pins into the 1x slot on the CM4 IO Board. You also need to supply at least 450W through the card's ATX12VO power plug.

There are two ways to try installing the driver:

### Proprietary Nvidia driver

After flashing the 64-bit Pi OS beta to my Pi, I made sure to upgrade everything on it, and install the kernel source, so the Nvidia driver would compile:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, if you have X server running (e.g. you are logged in via GUI), you need to log out. If you're running this over SSH or serial connection, you can quit X server with: `sudo systemctl stop lightdm`.

Now, download Nvidia's latest [AARCH64 Driver for ARM 64-bit processors](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/linux-aarch64-archive/), make the downloaded `.run` file executable, and run it with `sudo`:

```
chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-aarch64-525.89.02.run
sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-aarch64-525.89.02.run
```

After doing that, I was unable to get any display outputs through the card, and when running `startx`, I would get the error:

```
...

```

### Nouveau (open source) driver

To get the Nouveau driver loaded, you have to [recompile the Linux kernel for Pi OS](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/tree/master/extras/cross-compile).

Go to `Device Drivers` > `Graphics support` on the `menuconfig` step, and select the `Nouveau` driver to install.

If you want to be able to boot the Pi all the way, make sure to blacklist the `nouveau` kernel module:

```
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf

# Put this inside the file and save it:
blacklist nouveau
```

Now, after a reboot, you can explicitly load the module and see what happens by following `dmesg` in another terminal session:

```
sudo modprobe nouveau
```

TODO: What happens?
