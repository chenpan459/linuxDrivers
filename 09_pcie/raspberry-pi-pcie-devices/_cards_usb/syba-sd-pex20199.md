This is the best USB 3.0 card I tested, though I haven't yet tried out the Type-C USB 3.1 port to see if it behaves any differently from the Type-A USB 3.0 ports.

It has the VLI VL805 chipset in it, which is supported by Pi OS out of the box, and has an auxiliary SATA power input, though it is not required to use that power input at least for the two USB 3.0 Type-A ports.
