This USB 3.0 controller card has two external USB 3.0 ports, and a male header for two more internal ports, and it uses a Fresco Logic chipset (which is supported by Pi OS out of the box).

It was always recognized, and allowed USB devices to attach, but sometimes USB 3 devices would mount at USB 2 speeds (e.g. 480 Mbps instead of 5000 Mbps).
