This USB 3.0 controller card has four USB 3.0 ports, uses the VLI VL805 chipset (which is supported by Pi OS out of the box), and has a female 4-pin molex power connector that must be used to provide power to the card.

It was always recognized, and allowed USB devices to attach, but sometimes USB 3 devices would mount at USB 2 speeds (e.g. 480 Mbps instead of 5000 Mbps).
