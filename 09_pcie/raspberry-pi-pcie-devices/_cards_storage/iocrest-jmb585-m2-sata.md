This little SATA board is a convenient and compact way to add up to 5 SATA drives to a Raspberry Pi, either via a CM4 carrier board that has a built-in full-size (80mm) M.2 slot, or via a PCI Express x1 to M.2 adapter card.

Since mid-2021, [SATA support is built into the Raspberry Pi kernel](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/raspberry-pi-os-now-has-sata-support-built), so assuming you have updated to the latest version (`sudo apt upgrade -y`), this card should work out of the box.
