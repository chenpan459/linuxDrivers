This SATA controller works well with Raspberry Pi OS and allows attaching 4 SATA devices (powered separately). It uses the ASMedia 1064 chipset.

Since mid-2021, [SATA support is built into the Raspberry Pi kernel](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/raspberry-pi-os-now-has-sata-support-built), so assuming you have updated to the latest version (`sudo apt upgrade -y`), this card should work out of the box.
