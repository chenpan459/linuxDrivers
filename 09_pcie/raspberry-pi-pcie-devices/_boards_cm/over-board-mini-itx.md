In addition to the standard Raspberry Pi interfaces found on the various standard models and the Compute Module I/O board, the Over:Board offers a full-size PCI-Express slot (but still just the 1x single-lane PCI-E v2.0 bus), a 24-pin ATX power header, Real-Time Clock with backup battery, RS232 (DB9) COM port, USB 2.0 4-port hub with two physical ports, USB Audio IC with Line-out and Mic-in, and a USB SATA controller for HDD/SSD storage.

I've kept the PCI-Express lane clear to the slot for full performance expansion cards and offer the additional functionality using the USB 2.0 bus which gives minimal functionality without compromising expandability.
