The PiKVM v4 is the latest iteration of the reference PiKVM device. It comes in two CM4-powered variants: the Plus and the mini.

The mini is smaller and fanless, and provides the same basic functionality of the PiKVM v3. The Plus includes a fan, multiple power inputs, multiple HDMI outputs, and optional 4G or 5G cellular connectivity.
