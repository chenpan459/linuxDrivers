In just one rack unit up to 20 Compute Blades can be installed. Each Blade has its own NVMe SSD, 1 Gbps Ethernet with PoE support, and status LEDs. The TPM edition adds on a TPM 2.0 module, and the Dev module adds on a further set of features like HDMI, microSD, and USB-C ports.

See the Compute Blade website for more details.
