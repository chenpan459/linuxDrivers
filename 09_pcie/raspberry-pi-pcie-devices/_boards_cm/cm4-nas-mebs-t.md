This Compute Module 4 carrier board design exposes a subset of the CM4's interfaces, including its single PCIe gen 2 lane to accept an external SATA controller card. This design is based off of the official Raspberry Pi Foundation's CM4 IO board (the KiCad project is available on the [IO board official page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4-io-board/?resellerType=home)).

The project includes PCB Gerber files you can have printed, and a Thingiverse case design that holds the board, a fan, up to 4 3.5" hard drives, and an optional OLED display for NAS statistics.
