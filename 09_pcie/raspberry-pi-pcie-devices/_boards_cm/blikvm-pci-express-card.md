The BliKVM PCI Express CM4 Card slots into a PCI Express slot (with a x1 edge connector), but doesn't get power or connectivity through PCI Express. It instead gets power via PoE or from a rear USB-C port, since it is built to be an internal KVM over IP card. Basically, a PiKVM that's installed directly inside the computer, with Ethernet, USB, and power connections exposed on the back.
