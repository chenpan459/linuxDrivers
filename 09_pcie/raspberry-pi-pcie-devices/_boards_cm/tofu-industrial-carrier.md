The TOFU board is a 9cm x 9cm carrier board for use with Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4). Inspired by the official CM4IO board, it's intended for industrial applications. It may also be used by enthusiasts looking for a compact yet complete solution to interface the many inputs and outputs of the single board computer.

Some highlights include a M.2 2242 type B socket and micro-SIM card holder, Power over Ethernet support, and a variety of power inputs accepting a broad range of input voltages.

Optional accessories include a 'switchblade' case with easy access to the top and bottom, and an M-key to B-key adapter for mounting full-size 2280 NVMe SSDs.
