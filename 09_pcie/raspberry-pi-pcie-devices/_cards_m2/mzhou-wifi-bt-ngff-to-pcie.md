This adapter worked great with the [Intel AX200 Desktop Kit](https://amzn.to/2Ldea2t).

It should work with any of the shorter M.2 A/E/M-key devices, like the WiFi and Bluetooth combo adapters common in many laptop and desktop computers.

I've only tested the WiFi functionality on the card, though I don't doubt it would also work correctly for Bluetoothâ€”I may attempt to test that at a future time.

I am also planning on testing an M.2 Coral.ai TPU for AI/ML in this adapter, when I receive it!
