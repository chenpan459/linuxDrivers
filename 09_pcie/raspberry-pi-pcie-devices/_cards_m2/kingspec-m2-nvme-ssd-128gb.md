This NVMe SSD works great with the CM4, assuming you have a compatible M.2 B or B+M key slot.

I tested it in the TOFU carrier board, and was able to get the following benchmark results:

  - fio 1M seq read: 395MiB/s (414MB/s)
  - fio 1M seq write:  381MiB/s (400MB/s)
  - iozone 1M seq read:  369.77 MiB/s
  - iozone 1M seq write: 361.34 MiB/s
  - iozone 4k rand read: 39.57 MiB/s
  - iozone 4k rand write:  88.07 MiB/s

The drive did not seem to get too hot, though it was warm after running the benchmarks, and it fit well in the TOFU.
