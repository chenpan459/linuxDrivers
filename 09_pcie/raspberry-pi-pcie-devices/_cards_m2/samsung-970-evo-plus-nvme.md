I put this drive through its paces using an M.2 to PCI Express adapter card. It runs fastâ€”double the random IO performance when connected to the same Pi via a USB 3.0 adapter!

I am still doing some more testing on this drive to see how well I can get it to work with the Compute Module 4 as a viable boot volume or general fast storage device.
