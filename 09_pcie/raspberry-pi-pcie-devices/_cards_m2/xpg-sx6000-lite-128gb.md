So far I am unable to get this drive to be recognized by the Pi if using it with a standard M.2 to PCI Express adapter.

It does work, however, in any of the USB 3.0 to M.2 adapters I've used, so it may be using a protocol that is not supported for direct NVMe storage.

I am still doing some testing, so follow the linked GitHub issue for the latest information.
